            <p>Graciella Velasco, now 23 years old, was born in Ilocos Norte, Philippines, 
            and soon moved to Turlock, California at the age of 1 and a half years old. 
            She moved around a lot as a kid, living with numerous family members at a time, 
            but eventually finding a home in Lathrop, California with her parents and 3 younger 
            siblings. Out of the four siblings, she is the oldest and will be the first child to
             graduate from college. <br>
            <br>
             She is currently a full time student that currently goes to San Francisco State University. 
             She had originally went to Sacramento State to pursue a degree in Psychology. She changed 
             her mind mid college-career and decided to pursue design instead, which lead her to
             finding her passion again in San Francisco. Graciella is now finishing up her last year 
             at SF State and plans on getting a career in the UX/UI design field. Her goals are to hopefully 
             work for Apple Corporate in the UX department, or alongside smaller companies while she gets her
             career going right after graduation. Her hobbies include photography, dancing, trying new food, and traveling. 
             Graciella is also a big dog lover, which lead to her going through numberous rescues! She has always wanted to provide 
             a new home for a furry friend, so she recently adopted a non-profit organization rescue from Love Second Chances, that's
             a jindo/retriever mix named Loki.</p>
