# Project Overview
 For the Time Capsule Website project, I have created a multi-page personal website that is used to share my digital footprint. This website features a description about myself on the home page, following along with three other pages that includes my current usage date with my chosen apps and sites. My website is shown with text, images and a cohesive colored theme to share my personality. Building this website has helped me build my skills in HTML and CSS coding to create a functional site with visuals and design principles. I have also learned the process of being able to create a shareable link to access my website by creating a repsoitory on GitHub.
